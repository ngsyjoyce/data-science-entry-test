prompt_a = """
I am a marketing manager at a retail company and we have just finished 
a three-month campaign. My team has collected customer feedback through 
an online survey and we now have about 500 responses stored in a 
spreadsheet. Each response includes the customer's age group, the 
product they purchased, their satisfaction rating from 1 to 5, and a 
short written comment. I need to present the findings to our CEO next 
Friday in a way that is easy to understand. Can you analyse this data 
for me, highlight which age groups and products have the lowest 
satisfaction scores, identify the most common complaints from the 
written comments, and summarise everything in a short paragraph I can 
use as an executive summary?

# Task 1
# Read both prompts above carefully, then answer the questions below as comments.

# Q8a: Which prompt do you think will get a better response from an AI?
# Your answer:
# Prompt B

# Q8b: Give TWO reasons to support your choice.
# Your answer (Reason 1):
# Prompt B defines clearly the role that AI should adopt, the audience and  constraints of the output 
# Your answer (Reason 2):
# Prompt B provides step-by-step instructions, therefore AI is more likely to address each step of the defined task 

# Q8c: What is ONE strength of the prompt you did NOT choose?
# Your answer:
# Prompt A includes more information about the background and context for the request, which would help the AI better understand the needs and generate a more relevant response.

# Task 2
# Rewrite either prompt by borrowing ONE element from the other
# to make it stronger. Explain what you borrowed and why.
# Your answer:

# Role: You are a data analyst helping a marketing manager at a retail company.
